# Task Tracker Web App

This project aims to develop a Task Tracker web application using React, tailored for teams within an organization. Each task will possess essential properties such as Title, Description, Start Date (which aligns with the task's creation date), End Date (specific to tasks marked as Completed), Status (with options including Pending, In Progress, Completed, Deployed, and Deferred), Assignee (the task owner), and Priority (P0/P1/P2).

The application will provide intuitive features for sorting tasks based on Priority and start/end dates. Furthermore, users will have the ability to filter tasks by Date range (task creation date), Assignee, and Priority. These filters can be applied in various combinations, enabling users to tailor their view according to specific criteria, such as tasks assigned to a particular individual with a certain priority level.

* Key Features:

1. Responsive web design for seamless accessibility across devices.
2. Dynamic task management allowing users to add and delete tasks, with completed tasks being non-deletable.
3. Optional showcase of ReactNative skills through the development of Android/iOS apps.
